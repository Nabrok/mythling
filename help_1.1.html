        <p class="help_topic"><a id="Prerequisites">Prerequisites:</a></p>
        <ul>
          <li>A <a href="http://www.mythtv.org">MythTV</a> backend running version 0.27.</li>
          <li>A mobile device running Android 4.0 or later.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="help_topic"><a id="Setup">Setup:</a></p>
        <p>
          Launch Mythling and access the Settings action menu.  
          Basic configuration can be accomplished through the first three screens:
        </p>
        <div class="help_item">
          <img src="images/screenshots/network_settings.png"
            class="help_shot"
            alt="Network Settings" />
          <div class="help_text">
            <p>1. <span class="help_step">Network Settings</span></p>
            <p>Definitely start with an internal network.  For that you'll need to specify your mythbackend machine's host name or IP address.</p>
            <p>When you decide to set up external network access, then here you will also enter the externally-available host information.
            There are more details about this on the <a href="https://github.com/oakesville/mythling/wiki/External-Network-Access">Mythling Wiki on GitHub</a>.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="help_item">
          <img src="images/screenshots/playback_settings.png"
            class="help_shot"
            alt="Playback Settings" />
          <div class="help_text">
            <p>2. <span class="help_step">Playback Settings</span></p>
            <p>If you choose to play media on your Device, then no further configuration is required in Playback Settings
            (and on certain devices like Amazon Fire TV this screen is not even accessible).</p>
            <p>For playback on a MythTV frontend, Mythling uses either the <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Frontend_Service">MythTV Frontend Service</a> 
            or the <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Frontend_control_socket">Frontend Control Socket</a> interface (depending on the selected media type).
            So for frontend playback you'll need to specify the mythfrontend host name or IP address, along with the service port and socket control port.
            The frontend port and IP values are remembered, so you can readily switch back and forth between frontend and device playback.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="help_item">
          <img src="images/screenshots/connections.png"
            class="help_shot"
            alt="Connections" />
          <div class="help_text">
            <p>3. <span class="help_step">Connections</span></p>
            <p>Mythling streams content using the MythTV <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Services_API">Services API</a>.
            The Connections screen is where you specify the port on your backend machine where these services can be accessed.
            </p>
            <p>If you have Apache running on your backend server, then you may optionally enter the host and port for that.
            With a backend web host running you're able to use Mythling media services for retrieving media lists and program data.
            The advantages of using Mythling services include the ability to perform searches and to access your <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/MythMusic">MythMusic</a> library.
            Also, sorting and filtering are considerably faster with Mythling services since these take place on the server rather than on the device.
            The main drawback of using Mythling media services is that they require you to have Apache with PHP installed and running.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight:bold;">Note:</span> To play the actual content of a video or music file, Mythling always uses the 
              MythTV services API (there are no Mythling services for transcoding or serving media). 
            </p>
            <p>Lastly in Connections, using the MythWeb Access switch you can control whether <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/MythWeb">MythWeb</a> is available in the action menu.
            </p>
            <p>That's it for basic setup.  You're ready to access your MythTV media from anywhere.
            The sections below describe how to use Mythling.    
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <p class="help_topic"><a id="Navigation">Navigation:</a></p>
        <div class="help_item">
          <img src="images/screenshots/media_types.png"
            class="help_shot"
            alt="Media Types" />
          <div class="help_text">
            <p><span class="help_step">Media Types</span></p>
            <p>
              By default the initial media type is Recordings.
              To select a different type, touch the action menu labeled Recordings to show your other options as illustrated in this screenshot.  
            </p>
            <p>
              Mythling favors a hierarchical view of your media.
              Recordings are grouped by title so that when you touch a title you drill in to see the recordings for that title.
              When you select a media library type such as Videos or Movies, you'll notice that Mythling organizes your collection the same way it's arranged on your server's file system.
              This navigational approach is a key motivation behind Mythling.
              If you've spent time organizing your content into a directory structure, you'll appreciate that Mythling reflects that arrangement. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Information about Movies, TV Series and Videos is retrieved from the data in MythTV's videometadata table.
              To identify which videos are treated as Movies and TV Series, Mythling consults this video metadata.
              Optionally, if your server's directory structure already segregates according to these media types, you can use the Categories preference screen to specify their root locations.
              See <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/MythVideo#Metadata_Lookup">MythVideo Metadata Lookup</a> for more about metadata.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="help_item">
          <img src="images/screenshots/sorting.png"
            class="help_shot"
            alt="Sorting" />
          <div class="help_text">
            <p><span class="help_step">Sorting</span></p>
            <p>
              For most media types you can sort by Title, Date or Rating by choosing from the action menu as depicted here.
              The exceptions are Live TV and Music.
            </p>
            <p>
              Live TV listings are sorted numerically by channel and are limited to what's currently showing.
              Mythling does not provide any means to browse future listings or schedule recordings.
              For that purpose it's recommended that you enable the MythWeb option on the Connections preference screen,
              and use their excellent browser-based interface.   
            </p>
            <p>
              Music is always sorted alphabetically by filename or directory (and remember, music access requires <a href="https://github.com/oakesville/mythling/wiki/Mythling-Media-Services">Mythling Media Services</a>).
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="help_item">
          <img src="images/screenshots/searching.png"
            class="help_shot"
            alt="Searching" />
          <div class="help_text">
            <p><span class="help_step">Searching</span></p>
            <p>
              If you're using Mythling media services, you can perform global ad-hoc searches.
              As illustrated in this screenshot, searches span all media types, with the results indicating the type of each match.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can play your content directly from the search results in the usual manner described below under <a href="#Playback">Playback</a>.

          <div class="help_text">
            <p><span class="help_step">Layout</span></p>
            <p>
              Mythling offers three distinct viewing options: List, Detail and Split modes.  You can choose among these options by touching the layout action menu icon as illustrated in this
              screenshot.  List mode (depicted here) features a plain-text layout, while Detail mode displays metadata particulars (such as director, cast and description) along with artwork if available.
              Split mode shows a list on the left, and a sublist or detail view on the right.
            </p>
            <p>
              Detail mode uses a side-scrolling interface where you swipe from left-to-right or vice-versa to page forward and backward through the list.
              You can also jump ahead and back using the scrollbar at the bottom of the page.    
            </p>
            <p>
              In Split mode if a sublist appears on the right, touching an item in this list moves it to the left and drills into the details for the right-hand pane.
              If an item in the right-hand sublist represents a content file, you can bypass the detail view and play it directly using the long-touch gesture.    
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="help_text">
            <p><span class="help_step">Artwork &amp; Internet</span></p>
            <p>
              Artwork can be Coverart, Fanart, Banners, Screenshots or Preview Images.
              The artwork to display for each media type is controlled through the Artwork preference screen in Mythling settings.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your video metadata includes internet references to sites such as themoviedb.org, a link to the site info for your Movies and TV Series is displayed in detail view.
              The internet reference base URL for these links is controlled through the Categories preference screen in the Internet section.    
            </p>

            <p>
              Depending on your device hardware and Android version, the built-in video player may not handle an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming">HTTP Live Stream</a> delivered by MythTV.
              In that case you'll likely get an error message on playback indicating that "The video cannot be played".
              There are a number of excellent video player apps with HLS support available in the Google Play store (including VLC, DicePlayer and MX Player). 
            </p>
            <p>
              As you navigate through your media library in Mythling List Mode, content files are differentiated from folders or categories by an arrow symbol (&#x25ba;).
              In Detail Mode directories and categories are represented by a folder image with a link to drill in.
            </p>
            <p>
              Depending on the selected media type and view mode, a confirmation dialog as illustrated here may be presented when you touch a content file for playback.
              You have the option of directly streaming the raw content file or transcoding to HLS.  Raw streaming can be selected if your device is cabable of decoding the video format of the file. 
              When HLS playback is initiated Mythling first submits a transcode request to MythTV and awaits availability of the stream before launching the video player.
              For Live TV as an additional first step Mythling schedules a recording of the program through MythTV before sending either the transcode or streaming requests.
              For Music Mythling simply passes on the MythTV playback URL to the internal or Android media player, as designated in Playback settings.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your bandwidth permits, you'll want to configure higher resolutions and bitrates through the Video Quality preference screen. 
            </p>
            <p>
              If video playback results in a "no stream available" error, try increasing the Transcode Timeout under System settings.
